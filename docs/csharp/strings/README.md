# Strings in C#

## Usage

This is how we store text in C#.
`String` is an **immutable** (unchangeable) sequence of characters. 

::: tip Immutability
Immutable means it cannot change :neutral_face:.

So, whenever you create a `string`, it remains the same â€“ you can't ever change the `chars` inside of it, or its `size`.

The idea is that you can't manipulate an **existing** string.
