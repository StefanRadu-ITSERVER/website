# Generics

They brought with them the ability to combine type safety, 
reusability, and efficiency when working with collections of data. 

Generics give you a way to tell the C# compiler 
what kind of data type you intend to use with a given class. 
Without that class, having to know about that data type in advance. 

Without using generics, there's no built in way to detect 
when something that's not an integer is added to the array.

Generics provide the ability to instruct the compiler to restrict 
the contents of a wide variety of data structures, such as arrays, 
lists, stacks, queues, and dictionaries to only permit a specific kind of data, 
whether it is a C# data type or a custom class of your own.

The result is an application that is more efficient with fewer bugs, and with less code that you have to write yourself.
