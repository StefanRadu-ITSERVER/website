# C# Tips

C# provides various features that increase the developer's productivity such as:
- the `var` keyword
- LINQ
- Anonymous Types
- Lambda Expressions

### Why is this important?

If you have fewer lines of code, then the code becomes:
- more maintanable 
- less prone to bugs
- easier to understand
- faster to read

We read more code than we write it.

To be a good programmer, you need to write code that both computers and humans can read.
