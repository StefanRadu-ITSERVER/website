# Array Summary
So, we learned that:
+ an array is a bunch / group / collection of variables that are treated as one object;
+ when you create an array, first you need to declare a reference variable that points to the array. Then you need to create the array object;
+ you can specify how big you want your array to be.

## When to use arrays?
The array is amazing for storing a **fixed** list of values. It has a fixed length to work with, and this might be the problem. :sweat_smile:

## Why using arrays?
Arrays are useful because they provide the ability to store instances of a same type and at the same time manipulation of individual items.


## What are the drawbacks?

These are the drawbacks for arrays:
+ once you create an array, you can't change its length (fixed size);
+ you must know in advance how many elements are in an array;
+ you can't dynamically allocate memory (dynamic allocation);
+ the elements of array are stored in consecutive memory locations which means that insertions and deletions are very difficult and time consuming;
+ arrays are useful, but they are a bit “old-school” in their style.

Thanks for reading :D
