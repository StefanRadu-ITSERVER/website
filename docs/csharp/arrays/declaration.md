# Declaring Arrays

Let's see how we can create and initialize arrays in C#.

## How to create arrays?

Basically, there are a couple of ways and semantic differences that you can use. We are going through some of them and then conclude which ones to use in the future :smirk:

So, let's use the `string` type as the type for our array (you can choose any type you want: `int`, `double`, `Object`, `array` etc.).


### Declaration
Here we declare the array:
``` csharp
string[] fruits = 
```

### Assignment
Let's assign a value to the array:

``` csharp
string[] fruits = new string[];
```

We have to use the square brackets `[]` and since an array is indeed an `Object`, it is created with the `new` statement referred to by a variable (reference type). 

::: danger Fixed size
Unfortunately, we need to specify the **size** of the array when we create it. Arrays in C# are not **dynamic** in the sense that their **size** must be specified right at the beginning.
:::

Let's specify the size (or the capacity â€“ same thing) for our array:

``` csharp
string[] fruits = new string[4];
```

So this array has the size `4` which means it can hold `4` items.

::: warning Indexers
One thing to remember is that computers don't count like we count: we start by counting from 1 (1, 2, 3...), whereas computers count from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3...). This is how computers count :astonished:
:::

So, array indexes range from `0` to `array.Length - 1`. 

Nevertheless, let's continue.

## How to add items?
We can start putting items in some positions by adding two fruits:

``` csharp
fruits[0] = "apple";
fruits[1] = "cherry";
```

::: tip Remember
All collections start at index 0. This is where we put our apple :apple:.
:::

::: warning TIP
Notice that you don't have to fill **all** the positions of the array. We've just added `2` even though we had `4` position available. :wink:
:::

Let's try adding `3` more items and see what we get:

``` csharp
fruits[2] = "pineapple";
fruits[3] = "plum";
fruits[4] = "peach";
```

::: danger IndexOutOfRangeException
And we get the following exception: _System.IndexOutOfRangeException: 'Index was outside the bounds of the array._'
:::

This happend because we tried to add way to many items. The error was thrown by the third line with the peach :peach::
``` csharp {3}
fruits[2] = "pineapple";
fruits[3] = "plum";
fruits[4] = "peach";
```

So, essentially, we cannot:
- change the **size** of the array;
- **add** too many items to it; 
- ...
- do so many things :weary:

## List

This is where the Generic `List` comes into play :play_or_pause_button:. We are going to cover it soon...

::: tip List vs Arrays
Still, there are many use cases for the `Arrays` and we don't just throw them in the trash because they can't `resize` themselves :confused:. Maybe, in some scenarios this is the exact behaviour that what we want :smiley:
:::

---

To move on, we can remove that line and iterate through the array to display its values:

``` csharp
for(var i = 0; i < fruits.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(fruit[i]);
}
```

Now, this array has items from `fruits[0]` to `fruits[3]`.


### `Array.Resize()` method
There is a method called `Resize` which might do what it expresses through its name: to resize (change the **size**) of the array. But we said that the array it's **immutable** :fearful:. 


Well, this statement still holds true. What the `Resize` method does is that it's another array in the background and reassigns it to our array variable. So, it's not changing the array. Is this a **perfomance** issue? Certainly!

Let's see how it works. I want to remove half of the items for the array:

``` csharp
int[] numbers = new int[] { 23, 25, 64, 7, 5, 3, 2, 43, 53, 32 };
Console.WriteLine(numbers.Length); // 10

Array.Resize(ref numbers, 5);
Console.WriteLine(numbers.Length); // 5
```

> The Resize method allocates a new array with the specified size, copies elements from the old array to the new one, and then replaces the old array with the new one.

## Summarry
So, this is how you can create arrays. In the next post I am going to show you a faster, shorter way of doing declaration and initialization. ;)
