- [Unit Testing in JavaScript by Jesse Warden](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZEZPz6HkCZk30XEdl0eGNhwvoR-XoWHS)

This is a great and short resource to learn about Vuex.

- [JavaScript Essential Training by Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Essential-Training/574716-2.html) :heavy_check_mark:

One of the best series I have watched. He worked a lot to gather all the important bits and pieces of JavaScript and even for an intermidiate-advanced JS developer like me, having JS explained like this helped concretized and organised what I knew about it. I highly recommend it for beginners, but also for anybody else who wants to fill up all the gaps that they might have with JavaScript.\nIncredible course!

He didn't push back from explaining things in detail and at the same time provided four examples with code. Really nice!
