- [JavaScript Essential Training by Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Essential-Training/574716-2.html) :heavy_check_mark:

One of the best series I have watched. He worked a lot to gather all the important bits and pieces of JavaScript and even for an intermidiate-advanced JS developer like me, having JS explained like this helped concretized and organised what I knew about it. I highly recommend it for beginners, but also for anybody else who wants to fill up all the gaps that they might have with JavaScript.\nIncredible course!
