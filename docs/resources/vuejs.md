- [Learning Vue.js by Michael Sullivan](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Learning-Vue-js/562924-2.html) :heavy_check_mark:

I enjoyed the fact that he went relatively quick through theory and tried to apply the concepts. He didn't make an overly complicated story before explaining a concept, but he showed it straight away. This kept me somehow engaged, but the truth is that I already knew many things that he explained here.

- [Vue.js: Building an Interface by Ray Villalobos](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Vue-js-Building-Interface/609025-2.html/) :heavy_check_mark:

I do not recommend this resource. The author is not consistent with the chosen technology:
- he doesn't use ES6 consistently
- he uses jQuery instead of Axios (so not full integration with Vue related technologies)
- a lot of opying and pasting a lot of code
- the focus was not on the concepts of Vue.js

An interesting video to watch. A little bit long, but he explains what were the problems and therefore the need for libraries like Flux, Redux, Vuex etc.

### Series

- [Vue.js 2 - Getting Started](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51p-YU-Uw90qQH419BM4Iz07)

- [Vue JS 2 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQcYgjhBoeQH7wiAyZNrYa)

Good resource to learn Vue.js because the author goes through so many examples and explaines them very low level which is good for begginers. \nAlso, he covers many Vue concepts creating a very strong basis of Vue.js for future projects.

- [Vuex Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i371QO_Rtkl26MwtiJ30P2) :heavy_check_mark:

- [Testing Vue](https://laracasts.com/series/testing-vue) :heavy_check_mark:

This is an advanced series on Testing Vue.js apps. I reccomend having a strong understanding of JS, Vue and some Webpack for this.
It is a very useful resource to acquire the mindset of testing and the thought process. The author builds several components using TDD which are amazing for exercising this Extreme Programming approach.

- [Vue.js Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwAKR305CRO_1yAao-8aZiQnBqJeyng4O)

If you are a complete beginner with Vue, then this is for you. He explaines many Vue core concepts form the ground up.

- [Vue.js Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGADZuvKJweutZDOO9VI9YiJ9)

If you want a rather quick Vue walkthrough, then I would reccomend this resource. He manages in just a couple of videos to implement even AJAX requests, consuming a REST API, and integrating the Vue Router. Nice to see.

This blog post was too long. Too much explanation and usage of conceptual names. It was not a complete explample and I left that this was the intent to push people to his Pluralsight course.
