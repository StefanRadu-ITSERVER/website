# Visual Studio Code

My favorite thing about this editor is it's simplicity :heart_eyes:

My attention doesn't get consumer by unnecessary UI windows, buttons, things :unamused:

Beside its simplicity, VSCode is:
- free
- open source
- powerful
- extensible (meaning you can install many extensions)
- cross platform (powered by Electron.js :satisfied:)
- Hot Exit (keeps unsaved content)
- Monaco Editor (open source)
- built-in terminal
