# Introduction to TypeScript

## TypeScript and C#
Microsoft is responsible for the development of both TypeScript and C#. These languages are very similar and with a strong focus on OOP techniques.

## Why using TypeScript?
It creates a strongly-typed environment for web development.

This means that many errors are shown right when writing in the editor time instead of runtime.

## How TypeScript works?

TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript meaning that the code you deploy is pure JavaScript. 

TypeScript just helps the developer and won't end up in the final production code.
